    title: "Divide and Multiply Appium Test on CI"
    subtitle: "Mobile Test Automation is increasingly becoming very important. Almost all web applications are responsive these days and it's very important to test how the application works across devices. The same is true with the native application as well. At the same time, the number of devices and the custom OS versions on devices are also vast. This means that it's harder for a tester to manually run the automated tests over a list of devices to get device coverage and quicker results over every feature development.
Hence there is a need to run the tests in parallel, which provides faster feedback about the quality to your team. Keeping this in mind, I build this library called AppiumTestDistribution which would help people to run tests across devices both Android and iOS in ease without much setup."
